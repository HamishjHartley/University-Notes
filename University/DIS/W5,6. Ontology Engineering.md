[DIS-549 Module Overview](DIS-549%20Module%20Overview.md)
### Ontology Definition
An Ontology describes a formal specification of a certain domain, allowing a shared understanding of a domain of interest and Formal and machine manipulable model of a domain of interest. 
### Why they are used
- To share a common understanding of the structure of information among people or software agents
- Enable reuse of domain knowledge
- Make domain assumptions explicit
- Separate domain knowledge from the operation knowledge
- Analyse domain knowledge
### Ontology Structure
An ontology has four elements: **Classes, modifier, definables and relations.** 
##### Class
Self-standing entity that is a template for creating objects
##### Modifier
Properties, attributes or aspects that an object can have, such as name and DOB of class person
##### Definable
Class that is derived from other classes.
##### Relation
Links the two sides of the relation to each other, with the two sides being either classes or classes and modifier

### Ontology Design Example
*"We wish to create a database for a company that runs training
courses. For this, we must store data about each person such as the
trainees, the instructors and the courses that are presented. For each
person, we want to store national insurance number and a name.
Trainees have registration numbers and instructors have staff
numbers. A trainee takes many courses. Each course is presented
by one instructor and has a number of trainees. An instructor
presents many courses."*
- The following nouns can be distinguished: (Company, Course, Person, trainee, Instructor, National insurance number(NiN), name, registration number(RN) and Staff number(SN))
- The following verbs can be distinguished: (runs_course, takes_course and presents_course)

### DIKW Pyramid
4 layer pyramid; with Data a the bottom, which when it is related to each other forms Information, when the Information is analysed is becomes Knowledge. When principles about the patterns gained from Knowledge is understood, Wisdom is created. 
Wisdom can be utilised to answer questions/make predictions

### Top-down and Bottom-up approaches
In a top-down approach the super class(es)/concepts that are related to the domain are identified, then whilst going down the sub and sub-sub classes are identified down to the instances. In the Bottom-up approach, instances are started to conceptualise by performing an abstraction the identify the bottom class hierarchy. Then further up more abstraction is performed to identify middle classes, then reaching the super class(es)/concepts.

### Relations (roles, properties) characteristic types
##### Symmetry
A relation that has itself as an inverse
##### Transitivity
Single "hop" is implied over a chain of two along a given relation
##### Functionality
Any instance is related to at most one other instance
##### Reflexivity
Every instance is related to itself

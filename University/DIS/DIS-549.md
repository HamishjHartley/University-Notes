A model is a representation of a 'system', with a system representing a wide range of contexts such as lecture, human body, business etc. 

Usually a model is not related to one particular thing.

A model must have:
>Mapping criterion: Model maps to an original object
>
>Reduction criterion:  Not all properties of the original are mapped onto the model.
>
>Pragmatic criterion: The model must serve a purpose.

Models can serve multiple purposes such as to document, instruct, explore and educate.

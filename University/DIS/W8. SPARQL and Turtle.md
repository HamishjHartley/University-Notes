RDF serialisation: Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language)
Turtle allows description of an RDF graph in minimal textual form using abbreviations.
##### Turtle Abbreviations
- **Relative URI** - URIs written as shortcuts(portion of URI) and need base label to resolve the to absolute URIs (entire URI).
- **Base declaration** - Used to define a URI to be used with relative URI.
- **Prefixed Name** - Prefix names that need prefix label to resolve them to absolute URIs.
- **Prefix declaration** - Used to associate a label with a given URI.

###### Turtle Abbreviation:
- Relative URI is written as `<value>`
- base declaration is written as `@base<"URI">`
- Prefixed name is written as `:value`
- prefix declaration is written as `@prefix label:<"URI">`
###### Example
**N-Triple Format**
```
<https://knowledge.org/moon> <https://knowledge.org/landed>"1968" .
<https://knowledge.org/moon> <https://knowledge.org/Lunar_lander> <https://knowledge.org/Apollo> .
```

**Turtle Format**

In the above exam, there are only relative URIs that are given as `<value>`. We use the base directive to resolve these URI's such as: `base + moon is <https://knowledge.org/moon>`

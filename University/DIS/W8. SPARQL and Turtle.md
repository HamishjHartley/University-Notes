### 1. Turtle
RDF serialisation: Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language)
Turtle allows description of an RDF graph in minimal textual form using abbreviations.
##### Turtle Abbreviations
- **Relative URI** - URIs written as shortcuts(portion of URI) and need base label to resolve the to absolute URIs (entire URI).
- **Base declaration** - Used to define a URI to be used with relative URI.
- **Prefixed Name** - Prefix names that need prefix label to resolve them to absolute URIs.
- **Prefix declaration** - Used to associate a label with a given URI.
###### Turtle Abbreviation:
- Relative URI is written as `<value>`
- base declaration is written as `@base<"URI">`
- Prefixed name is written as `:value`
- prefix declaration is written as `@prefix label:<"URI">`
###### Example
**N-Triple Format**
```
<https://knowledge.org/moon> <https://knowledge.org/landed>"1968" .
<https://knowledge.org/moon> <https://knowledge.org/Lunar_lander> <https://knowledge.org/Apollo> .
```

**Turtle Format**
![[Pasted image 20240416114303.png]]
In the above example, there are only relative URIs that are given as `<value>`. We use the base directive to resolve these URI's such as: `base + moon is <https://knowledge.org/moon>`

###### *Another example*
N-triple format
```
<"http://resource.org/strath> <"http://strathclude.ac.uk/name> "Strathclyde" .
<"http://resource.org/strath> <"http://strathclude.ac.uk/location> <"http://resource.org/Glasgow> .
```
Turtle format
![[Pasted image 20240416153912.png]]
In the above example, there are both prefix names and relative URI's. Prefix names are given as `label:value`. Prefix directives are used to resolve these URI's such as:
`prefix:name is <"http:/strathclyde.ac.uk/name"`
 

##### Turtle Abbreviation
###### Semi-colon
Turtle aims to provide minimal textual representation, the previous example has redundancy as the subject is repeated. Turtle provides a solution to this by using a semi-colon at the end which indicates that the next statement has the same subject:
```
@prefix dc:<http://strathclyde.ac.uk/>.
@base <http://resource.org/>.
<strath> dc:name "Strathclyde";
<strath> dc:location "Glasgow".
```
Becomes:
```
@prefix dc:<http://strathclyde.ac.uk/>.
@base <http://resource.org/>.
<strath> dc:name "Strathclyde";
		 dc:location "Glasgow".
```
The second `<strath>` tag can be removed.
###### Comma
If both the subject and property are the same in the next statement, then the line can be ended by a comma to avoid repetition.
```
@prefix dc:<http://strathclyde.ac.uk/>.
@base <http://resource.org/>.
<strath> dc:dept "CIS".
<strath> dc:dept "ENG".
<strath> dc:dept "PHY" .
```
Becomes
```
@prefix dc:<http://strathclyde.ac.uk/>.
@base <http://resource.org/>.
<strath> dc:dept "CIS" ,
		 dc:dept "ENG" ,
		 dc:dept "PHY" .
```
###### Blank Note
`_:label` represents a blank node e.g, `_:lbl ex:has ex:child` 
`[]` Square brackets represent unlabelled blank node, e.g. `[] ex:has ex:child`
```
@prefix dc:
<http://strathclyde.ac.uk/> .
dc:cis dc:has _:nv .
_:nv dc:title "CIS" .
_:nv dc:has "AI" 
```
Becomes:
```
@prefix dc:
<http://strathclyde.ac.uk/> .
dc:cis dc:has [
dc:title "CIS" ;
dc:has "AI " ] .
```

### 2. SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language)
SPARQ is query language for RDF graphs. It has similarity to SQL, an example is shown below:

```
PREFIX bok:<http://example.org/book/>

SELECT ?name
FROM <http://example.org/personal>
WHERE {
		?s:bok:author ?name.
		?s rdf:type bok:person
}
```

| PREFIX | Turtle prefix directive for prefix names abbreviations                                               |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SELECT | Determine which variables will be in the result                                                      |
| FROM   | Identify the RDF dataset (graph of triples) to be queried                                            |
| WHERE  | Identify the query pattern to be satisfied by the result. The patterns are a set of Turtle triple(s) |
##### SPARQL Patterns
The WHERE part describes a pattern of triple(s) that the query will look for in the considered RDF graph.
